| Machine learning relies heavily on mathematical concepts, particularly linear algebra, calculus, and probability.                                                          | Machine learning is pure maths-and relies on linear algebra, calculus and probability.                                                                                                                           |
| At its core, a machine learning algorithm seeks to minimize a cost function, which measures the difference between predictions and actual outcomes.                        | These calculate the difference, or error, between what you predicted would happen and what actually occurred.                                                                                                    |
| Gradient descent, an optimization technique, iteratively adjusts model parameters by calculating gradients (partial derivatives) to find the minimum of the cost function. | Such a model will usually apply an optimization technique-such as gradient descent-that will adjust its calculations, or parameters, to get ever closer to reduce this error.                                    |
| For example, in linear regression, the cost function is the mean squared error, minimized to fit a line through data points.                                               | Linear regression, for example, calculates the mean squared error-this is the average of all the errors-and looks to minimize this to fit a straight line through the given data points.                         |
| Neural networks, the backbone of deep learning, use layers of interconnected nodes that apply matrix operations from linear algebra.                                       | In the realm of artificial neural networks (ANNs), of which you may have heard used in deep learning, these rely on interconnected layers-nodes-to recognise things in the data using linear algebra operations. |
| A popular architecture, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), excels at image recognition by identifying patterns through filters.                                         | Conventional neural networks (CNNs) are used for image recognition, while probabilistic models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are popular for NLP and voice analysis.       |
| Despite the complexity of its mathematics, machine learning transforms industries by automating predictions, detecting patterns, and driving innovation.                   | It has been forecast that around 9 out of 10 businesses will be integrating machine learning by the end of this decade. Machine learning has great potential but is complex!                                     |
| Formal, precise, and comprehensive.                                                                                                                                        | More informal and concise, sometimes sacrificing precision for readability.                                                                                                                                      |
